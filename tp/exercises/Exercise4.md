## Question 3 : Why do we need both a database constrain and a validation in typescript for the same check?

We need both a database constrain and a validation in typescript for the same check because the database constrain is used to check the email format in the database and the validation in typescript is used to check the email format before the query is executed. This way, we can format an error message to the end user easily and securely without having to catch the error in the database.
