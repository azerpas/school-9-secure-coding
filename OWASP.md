# OWASP Top Ten 2017

## 1. Injection

Injection flaws occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data or execution of arbitrary code. Examples include SQL injection, LDAP injection, and XPath injection.

Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password';
```
In the above SQL query, an attacker can input a malicious value for `$username` or `$password` that alters the SQL query, allowing them to access sensitive information.

## 2. Broken Authentication and Session Management

Broken authentication and session management occur when session IDs, passwords, or other authentication tokens are not properly protected, allowing attackers to hijack user accounts. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, theft of personal information, and more.

Example:

A website that stores user passwords in plaintext or uses weak encryption can make it easy for attackers to steal passwords and gain access to user accounts.

## 3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

XSS occurs when untrusted data is sent to a web browser without proper validation or escaping, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts. These scripts can be used to steal user data, modify web content, or execute arbitrary code.

Example:

A website that allows users to input comments without proper validation or escaping can be vulnerable to XSS attacks. An attacker can inject a malicious script into a comment that steals user data or modifies web content.

```html
<form>
  <label for="comment">Comment:</label><br>
  <textarea id="comment" name="comment"></textarea><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```
In the above HTML code, an attacker can input a malicious script in the `comment` field.

## 4. Broken Access Control

Broken access control occurs when a web application does not properly enforce access controls, allowing unauthorized users to access sensitive data or functionality. This can include privilege escalation, bypassing authorization checks, and more.

Example:

A web application that allows users to access sensitive information without proper authentication or authorization can be vulnerable to broken access control. An attacker can gain access to sensitive data by exploiting these vulnerabilities.

## 5. Security Misconfiguration

Security misconfiguration occurs when a web application is not properly configured, allowing attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in the application. This can include outdated software, default passwords, and more.

Example:

A web application that uses default passwords or outdated software can be vulnerable to security misconfiguration. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the application.

## 6. Insecure Cryptographic Storage

Insecure cryptographic storage occurs when sensitive data is not properly encrypted or hashed, allowing attackers to steal or modify the data. This can include passwords, credit card numbers, and more.

Example:

A web application that stores user passwords in plaintext or uses weak encryption can be vulnerable to insecure cryptographic storage. An attacker can steal user passwords and gain access to user accounts.

```python
import hashlib

password = "password123"
hash_object = hashlib.sha256(password.encode('utf-8'))
print(hash_object.hexdigest())
```
In the above Python code, the password "password123" is hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm.

## 7. Insufficient Transport Layer Protection

Insufficient transport layer protection occurs when sensitive data is transmitted over an unencrypted channel, allowing attackers to intercept and steal the data. This can include credit card numbers, login credentials, and more.

Example:

A website that transmits sensitive data over an unencrypted channel can be vulnerable to insufficient transport layer protection. An attacker can

```html
<form action="https://example.com/login" method="post">
  <label for="username">Username:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="username" name="username"><br>
  <label for="password">Password:</label><br>
  <input type="password" id="password" name="password"><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```
In the above HTML code, the form data is transmitted over an unencrypted channel.

## 8. Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards

Unvalidated redirects and forwards occur when a web application allows users to specify a target URL for a redirect or forward, without proper validation. This can be used to trick users into visiting malicious websites or phishing pages.

Example:

A web application that allows users to specify a redirect URL without proper validation can be vulnerable to unvalidated redirects and forwards. An attacker can craft a malicious URL that redirects the user to a phishing page.

```html
<a href="https://example.com/redirect?url=https://malicious.com/phishing">Click Here</a>
```
In the above HTML code, the `url` parameter is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to specify a malicious URL.

## 9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities

Using components with known vulnerabilities occurs when a web application uses outdated or vulnerable third-party components, allowing attackers to exploit known vulnerabilities.

Example:

A web application that uses outdated versions of third-party software can be vulnerable to using components with known vulnerabilities. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the application.

## 10. Insufficient Logging and Monitoring

Insufficient logging and monitoring occurs when a web application does not properly log and monitor security events, making it difficult to detect and respond to security breaches.

Example:

A web application that does not log login attempts or suspicious activity can be vulnerable to insufficient logging and monitoring. An attacker can gain access to sensitive information without being detected.
